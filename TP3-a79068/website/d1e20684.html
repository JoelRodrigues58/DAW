      <h3>99. The Shaking</h3>
      
      
      In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 
      
      <p>When the earth is shaken with her (violent) shaking,</p>
      
      <p>And the earth brings forth her burdens,</p>
      
      <p>And man says: What has befallen her?</p>
      
      <p>On that day she shall tell her news,</p>
      
      <p>Because your Lord had inspired her.</p>
      
      <p>On that day men shall come forth in sundry bodies that they may be shown their
         works.
      </p>
      
      <p>So he who has done an atom's weight of good shall see it.</p>
      
      <p>And he who has done an atom's weight of evil shall see it.</p>
