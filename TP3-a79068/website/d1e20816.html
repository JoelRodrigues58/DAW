      <h3>102. The Multiplication of Wealth and Children</h3>
      
      
      In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 
      
      <p>Abundance diverts you,</p>
      
      <p>Until you come to the graves.</p>
      
      <p>Nay! you shall soon know,</p>
      
      <p>Nay! Nay! you shall soon know.</p>
      
      <p>Nay! if you had known with a certain knowledge,</p>
      
      <p>You should most certainly have seen the hell;</p>
      
      <p>Then you shall most certainly see it with the eye of certainty;</p>
      
      <p>Then on that day you shall most certainly be questioned about the boons.</p>
