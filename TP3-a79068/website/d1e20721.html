      <h3>100. The Assaulters</h3>
      
      
      In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 
      
      <p>I swear by the runners breathing pantingly,</p>
      
      <p>Then those that produce fire striking,</p>
      
      <p>Then those that make raids at morn,</p>
      
      <p>Then thereby raise dust,</p>
      
      <p>Then rush thereby upon an assembly:</p>
      
      <p>Most surely man is ungrateful to his Lord.</p>
      
      <p>And most surely he is a witness of that.</p>
      
      <p>And most surely he is tenacious in the love of wealth.</p>
      
      <p>Does he not then know when what is in the graves is raised,</p>
      
      <p>And what is in the breasts is made apparent?</p>
      
      <p>Most surely their Lord that day shall be fully aware of them.</p>
